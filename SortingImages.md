CoordinatePictures is used to rename and organize image files.

Here's a walkthrough of how it works:

I have downloaded a lot of images in the past few weeks. 



for example, let's say you have a directory full of many images of artwork.
to organize this directory, you would like to sort the images into subdirectories called
'drawings', 'photographs', 'paintings', and 'other'.

Here is how to do this with CoordinatePictures:
Open CoordinatePictures, choose Categorize and Rename Pictures from the 'Sort Pictures' menu.
Enter the directory containing pictures to sort.
A window will open, showing the first image alphabetically.
Choose Edit Categories... from the Category menu.
The default categories are Art, Comedy, Serious, and Other. For our example, type

	D/drawings/drawings|H/photos/photos|P/paintings/paintings|O/other/other

Notice that this contains groups separated by | and /
The first capital letter of the group is a keyboard shortcut to assign the current image to this category.
The second part of the group will be used as the readable 'name' of the category.
The third part of the group will be appended to the filename when a file is assigned this category.

# Sorting Images

### Part One: Sorting into categories

* Open labs\_coordinate\_pictures

* Choose 'Assign pictures to categories...' from the Pictures menu

* Enter the directory containing the unsorted images and click OK

The 'gallery' will now open.

In the screenshot above, the text s(452x452) means that the current image is 452 by 452 pixels, and has been resized down to fit the current dimensions of the window. You can use the arrow keys Left and Right to browse through the images, press h to rename, Ctrl-[ to resize, and so on.

Right now, though, let's continue on our mission of organization.

* Choose 'Edit Categories...' from the Categories menu

* Enter "T/twitter/twitter|A/album covers/album covers|Q/other/other" and click OK

From now on, pressing Shift-T is a keyboard shortcut to assign the current image to the Twitter category. These keyboard shortcuts are also shown to the left of the image:

* I'll press Shift-A because this image belongs under 'album covers'. I'll then be shown the next image in the directory and press the corresponding keyboard shortcut.

* I'll erase an image by pressing Delete (can be undone by pressing Ctrl-Z).

* I'll continue assigning images to categories until all are complete.

* Then, I'll press Ctrl-Enter, which moves the images into a subdirectory.

All we've done is separated images into subdirectories, but we've done it quickly using customized keyboard shortcuts.

(Behind the scenes, assigning an image to the "twitter" category appends "\_\_MARKAS\_\_twitter" to its filename; Ctrl-Enter looks for images that have been named in this way and moves them into a subdirectory).
